# EmailPrinter
A python script that monitors given email adress and checks for an email with attachments, which it prints. 

My family's home printer was somewhat old and incapable of connecting to our house's wifi network. As such, it being in the basement made printing files difficult and tedious. This simple script was made to be run on a Rasberry Pi that was connected to our printer. It logged into and repeatedly checked an email adress I created to which files could be sent. Then, the files were processed and sent to the printer to be printed. The credentials have obviously been removed for public use, but can be simply edited with other credentials to use this.
